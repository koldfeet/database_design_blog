                                    </div><br>
                                    <p>
                                        The first place to start when learning how to design a database is to work out
                                        what the purpose is.<br><br>
                                        Why are you designing a database? No, this isn’t just because someone told you
                                        do, or because
                                        your software needs it. What is the aim of the database? What is it
                                        storing?<br><br>
                                        Thinking about the aim of the database for the first step will help you make
                                        decisions about it later on. Some examples of database purposes are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Storing customer transactions on your website</li>
                                        <li>Storing definitions of teams and players</li>
                                        <li>Storing reference data for your website</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <strong>Lastly:</strong>
                                    Sure, it’s possible for a database to store a large amount of different kinds of
                                    information, but if
                                    you start with the purpose, it will make this process easier.
                                    </p>

                                    <div class="center-my-h3">
                                        <h3 class="my-h3">Step 2: List What You’re Storing Data About</h3>
                                    </div><br>
                                    <p>
                                        Alright, so you’ve got your purpose. Now it’s time to decide what it’s going to
                                        store.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This is where we go into a little more detail on the database. To give an
                                        example, let’s say
                                        we’re creating a database <strong>to store customer transactions on your website
                                            that sells books</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> <strong>Books- </strong> What books we have for sale</li>
                                        <li> <strong>Customers-</strong> Who our customers are</li>
                                        <li> <strong>Sales-</strong> A list of sales of these books</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    To keep it simple, I won’t include other possibilities such as promotions or authors
                                    or anything.
                                    Write this list as a list of “items”. See how I’ve used “books, customers, sales”
                                    above?<br><br>
                                    Also, make them plural. It’s easier to think of what to store data about if you
                                    think of plural.
                                    This could be because each row in a table represents one of these items, and a table
                                    contains many of them.
                                    </p>

                                    <div class="center-short-line">
                                        <hr class="short-short-line">

                                    <div class="center-my-h3">
                                        <h3 class="my-h3">Step 3: Define The Attributes</h3>
                                    </div><br>
                                    <p>
                                        Now we have our list of items, or tables, that we’re storing data about. The
                                        next step is to
                                        decide what to store about each of these.<br><br>
                                        Think about what you need to know about each of these items. What would people
                                        want to know?
                                        What do you want to know? What represents these items?<br><br>
                                        We can use the book database again. Using these tables, I can list several
                                        attributes:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Books – title, author, price</li>
                                        <li>Customers – first name, last name, address</li>
                                        <li>Sales – sale date, customer, book, price</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    This is another simplification of a real database, but it explains the point. As
                                    shown above, the
                                    “books” table would need a few attributes. For each book, we need to know the
                                    <strong>title</strong>, the <strong>author</strong>, and
                                    the <strong>price</strong> of the book. These will become attributes, or columns, in
                                    the table.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We have our tables with our columns, or attributes. At the moment, they are just
                                        tables, sitting
                                        by themselves. To make them work, we need to link them together.<br><br>
                                        This is what a relationship is. No, I’m not talking about dating, I’m talking
                                        about a link
                                        between two tables in a database!<br><br>
                                        A relationship is a <strong>link between two related tables in a database that
                                            defines how the data is structured</strong>. Mostly, they represent real
                                        world scenarios.<br><br>
                                    </p>

                                    </div><br>
                                    <p>
                                        Each table in a database needs to have a unique identifier. This is a column
                                        that can be used to
                                        identify this row and only this row. This is often called a primary key. It’s
                                        done as part of
                                        the normalisation process of a database.<br><br>
                                        The simplest way to do this is to add an attribute to each table to identify it
                                        (we could use concepts called “surrogate keys” or “composite keys”, but to keep
                                        it simple,
                                        let’s stick to a
                                        single new column). I like to use the name of the table with the letters ID at
                                        the end of it.<br><br>
                                        For each of our tables, we can add the following attributes.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Books – title, author, price, book ID</li>
                                        <li>Customers – first name, last name, address, customer ID</li>
                                        <li>Sales – sale date, customer, book, price, sale ID</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    I’ve underlined the new fields, as this is the convention for indicating these
                                    identifying
                                    attributes. Learning how to design a database means learning these little things as
                                    well.
                                    </p>

                                    <div class="center-short-line">
                                        <hr class="short-short-line">

                                    <p>
                                        Now, we need to go back to our relationships, and learn how to link them. They
                                        are linked using these new ID fields we created, and these ID fields need to be
                                        in both tables.<br><br>
                                        The “has many” sentences we created before can be used to structure our tables.
                                        As mentioned before, I have two of the “has many” statements and three tables.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A book has MANY sales</li>
                                        <li>A customer has MANY sales</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    What does this mean? It means that for each sale record, it has one book. It means
                                    that each book can have many sales.<br><br>
                                    To identify this relationship, we need to add the ID from one table into the other.
                                    Can we add the sale ID into the books table? We can’t because this would mean we can
                                    only store one sale ID for a book, and a book has many sales.

                                        These SQL commands are mainly categorized into for categories as: DDL – Data
                                        Definition Language, DQL – Data Query Language, DML – Data Manipulation

                                    <p>DDL or Data Definition Language consists of the SQL commands that can be used to
                                        define the database schema. It is used to create and modify the structure of
                                        database objects in the database. DDL is a set of SQL used to create, modify,

                                        According to Microsoft, normalization is the process of organizing data in a
                                        database. This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between
                                        those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make
                                        the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent
                                        dependency.

                                        <li>Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.</li>
                                        <li>Create a separate table for each set of related data.</li>

                                    Do not use multiple fields in a single table to store similar data. For example,
                                    to track an inventory item that may come from two possible sources, an inventory
                                    record may contain fields for Vendor Code 1 and Vendor Code 2.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records.

                                    Records should not depend on anything other than a table's primary key (a compound
                                    key, if necessary). For example, consider a customer's address in an accounting
                                    system. The address is needed by the Customers table, but also by the Orders,
                                    Shipping, Invoices, Accounts Receivable, and Collections tables. Instead of storing
                                    the customer's address as a separate entry in each of these tables, store it in one
                                    place, either in the Customers table or in a separate Addresses table.

                                    Values in a record that are not part of that record's key do not belong in the
                                    table. In general, anytime the contents of a group of fields may apply to more than
                                    a single record in the table, consider placing those fields in a separate table.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For example, in an Employee Recruitment table, a candidate's university name and
                                        address may be included. But you need a complete list of universities for group
                                        mailings. If university information is stored in the Candidates table, there is
                                        no way to list universities with no current candidates. Create a separate
                                        Universities table and link it to the Candidates table with a university code
                                        key.
