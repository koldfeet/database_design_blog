                            </div><br>
                            <p>
                                The first place to start when learning how to design a database is to work out what the
                                purpose
                                is.<br><br>
                                Why are you designing a database? No, this isn’t just because someone told you do, or
                                because
                                your software needs it. What is the aim of the database? What is it storing?<br><br>
                                Thinking about the aim of the database for the first step will help you make decisions
                                about it
                                later on. Some examples of database purposes are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Storing customer transactions on your website</li>
                                <li>Storing definitions of teams and players</li>
                                <li>Storing reference data for your website</li>
                            </ul>

                            <strong>Lastly:</strong>
                            Sure, it’s possible for a database to store a large amount of different kinds of
                            information, but if
                            you start with the purpose, it will make this process easier.
                            </p>

                                <hr class="short-short-line">
                            </div>
                            <div class="center-my-h3">
                                <h3 class="my-h3">Step 2: List What You’re Storing Data About</h3>
                            </div><br>
                            <p>
                                Alright, so you’ve got your purpose. Now it’s time to decide what it’s going to store.
                                <br><br>
                                This is where we go into a little more detail on the database. To give an example, let’s
                                say
                                we’re creating a database <strong>to store customer transactions on your website that
                                    sells
                                    books</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li> <strong>Books- </strong> What books we have for sale</li>
                                <li> <strong>Customers-</strong> Who our customers are</li>
                                <li> <strong>Sales-</strong> A list of sales of these books</li>
                            </ul>
                            To keep it simple, I won’t include other possibilities such as promotions or authors or
                            anything.
                            Write this list as a list of “items”. See how I’ve used “books, customers, sales”
                            above?<br><br>

                            Also, make them plural. It’s easier to think of what to store data about if you think of
                            plural.
                            This could be because each row in a table represents one of these items, and a table
                            contains many
                            of them.
                            </p>

                            <div class="center-short-line">
                                <hr class="short-short-line">
                            </div>
                            <div class="center-my-h3">
                                <h3 class="my-h3">Step 3: Define The Attributes</h3>
                            </div><br>
                            <p>
                                Now we have our list of items, or tables, that we’re storing data about. The next step
                                is to
                                decide what to store about each of these.<br><br>
                                Think about what you need to know about each of these items. What would people want to
                                know?
                                What do you want to know? What represents these items?<br><br>
                                We can use the book database again. Using these tables, I can list several attributes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Books – title, author, price</li>
                                <li>Customers – first name, last name, address</li>
                                <li>Sales – sale date, customer, book, price</li>
                            </ul>
                            This is another simplification of a real database, but it explains the point. As shown
                            above, the
                            “books” table would need a few attributes. For each book, we need to know the
                            <strong>title</strong>, the <strong>author</strong>, and
                            the <strong>price</strong> of the book. These will become attributes, or columns, in the
                            table.
                            </p>

                                We have our tables with our columns, or attributes. At the moment, they are just tables,
                                sitting
                                by themselves. To make them work, we need to link them together.<br><br>
                                This is what a relationship is. No, I’m not talking about dating, I’m talking about a
                                link
                                between two tables in a database!<br><br>
                                A relationship is a <strong>link between two related tables in a database that defines
                                    how the
                                    data is
                                    structured</strong>. Mostly, they represent real world scenarios.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                <h3 class="my-h3">Step 5: Decide On A Unique Identifier</h3>
                            </div><br>
                            <p>
                                Each table in a database needs to have a unique identifier. This is a column that can be
                                used to
                                identify this row and only this row. This is often called a primary key. It’s done as
                                part of
                                the normalisation process of a database.<br><br>
                                The simplest way to do this is to add an attribute to each table to identify it (we
                                could use
                                concepts called “surrogate keys” or “composite keys”, but to keep it simple, let’s stick
                                to a
                                single new column). I like to use the name of the table with the letters ID at the end
                                of
                                it.<br><br>
                                For each of our tables, we can add the following attributes.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Books – title, author, price, book ID</li>
                                <li>Customers – first name, last name, address, customer ID</li>
                                <li>Sales – sale date, customer, book, price, sale ID</li>
                            </ul>
                            I’ve underlined the new fields, as this is the convention for indicating these identifying
                            attributes. Learning how to design a database means learning these little things as well.
                            </p>

                            <div class="center-short-line">
                                <hr class="short-short-line">
                            </div>
                            <div class="center-my-h3">
                                <h3 class="my-h3">Step 6: Include The Identifiers In Each Table</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Now, we need to go back to our relationships, and learn how to link them. They are
                                linked using
                                these new ID fields we created, and these ID fields need to be in both tables.<br><br>
                                The “has many” sentences we created before can be used to structure our tables. As
                                mentioned
                                before, I have two of the “has many” statements and three tables.
                            <ul>
                                <li>A book has MANY sales</li>
                                <li>A customer has MANY sales</li>
                            </ul>
                            What does this mean? It means that for each sale record, it has one book. It means that each
                            book
                            can have many sales.<br><br>
                            To identify this relationship, we need to add the ID from one table into the other. Can we
                            add the
                            sale ID into the books table? We can’t because this would mean we can only store one sale ID
                            for a
                            book, and a book has many sales.
